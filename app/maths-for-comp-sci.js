        <h3>Polynomial</h3>

        <p>I was reading the great book by Jeremy Kun <a href="https://pimbook.org/">A programmers introduction to mathematics</a>, I recommend
        highly taking a read of this. Polynomials are discussed here and I just wanted record my notes. Degree is used a lot and a clear definition of this is defined
        <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/degree-expression.html"> here</a>. It is also critical to remember that polynomials can be displayed as <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials-behave.html">graphs</a>.

        <h3>Proofs</h3>
        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>To begin with proofs we will list some key definitions. A proposition is a statement that can either be true
            or false. This adds limitations to statements but it is difficult to know if the statement is true or false.
            This relates to computer programming as developers we need to ensure correctness of our programs. Similarly
            a <strong>predicate</strong> is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more
            variables. <strong>Axioms</strong> are propositions that are accepted as true. A <strong>proof</strong> is a
            sequence of logical deductions found from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the
            porposition in question (Lehman et al ...). A <strong>theorem</strong> is a result that has been proved true
            and a <strong>lemma</strong> is a preliminary proposition proved true. </p>


        <h4>Proof Methods</h4>
        <h6>Proof by Direct Implication</h6>
        <p>Running through the example provided in <a href="https://jeremykun.com/2013/02/16/methods-of-proof-direct-implication/">Jeremy Kun awesome primers! </a>
        lets prove that <i>that one set is a subset of another</i>. Obviously if the sets are finite then you could manually check each value, computer could do this fairly fast,
        but it would not be efficient! Lets define two sets:</p>
