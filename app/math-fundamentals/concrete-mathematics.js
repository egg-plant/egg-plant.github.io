        <h2>Concrete Mathematics</h2>

        <p>The introduction chapter of Concrete Mathematics is tough, I have found that with many Computer Science Textbooks, so its sometimes good to revisit the first chapter once you have tried the relevant chapters, as the first usually covers a snapshot from the rest of the book. </p>

        <h3>Recurrent Problems</h3>

        <h4>Tower of Hanoi Problem: The Maths Explained</h4>

    

        <p><Latex>The Tower of Hanoi problem is a bit of fun, but the recurrence math behind it is intimidating, I hope we can walk through this and manage to get you to understand it as I have managed too with a lot of effort!</Latex></p>
    
        <h3>Sums</h3>

     <p><Latex>As part of this course polynomical knowledge is expected to be known which may not be the case if students did not have a great maths experience at earlier school years. They come to a specific case $n^2 = (2k)^2$ this is the same as $n^2 = 4k^2$. This is fairly trivial to understand as you take $(2k)\times(2k) = 2\times2$ and $k\times k = 4k^2$.</Latex></p>
        <h3>Integer Functions</h3>
