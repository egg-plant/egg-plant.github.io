  <p><Latex>As part of this course polynomical knowledge is expected to be known which may not be the case if students did not have a great maths experience at earlier school years. They come to a specific case $n^2 = (2k)^2$ this is the same as $n^2 = 4k^2$. This is fairly trivial to understand as you take $(2k)\times(2k) = 2\times2$ and $k\times k = 4k^2$.</Latex></p>
