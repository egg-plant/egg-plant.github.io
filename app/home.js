    text: [<div><p>Hello and congratulations on finding <strong>The Perks of Computer Science</strong>. This blog will become a treasure chest of technical and mathematical knowledge for all those interested in computer science and programming to use. Suitable for all but especially for those who like to learn with all the details and solid examples, no more algorithm teachers assumptions.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                       <p>Please check the side menu on the top left or the rather fancy buttons at the bottom to link to the sections. We cover the <strong>Fundamentals of Mathematics&#39;s</strong> starting with some BiteSize Maths a few Prerequisites from Stanford and finally looking in depth at the book Concrete Mathematics. A study of <strong>Mathematics for Computer Science</strong> using course content from <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm">MIT</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/">Stanford</a> follows using the fundamental knowledge. <strong>Algorithms</strong> will then be discussed in detail building them imperatively and functionally using C and Clojure respectively. We then have a dig into the world of <strong>Functional Programming</strong> using the text book the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</a> as the basis and Clojure as the main language. <strong>Hipster Clojure</strong> contains some great insight into our Clojure projects as well as some blog posts on interesting work going on in that space and frameworks used such as Kafka and Cassandra! The Kafka section is super interesting and is very full would definitely recommend it! The trendy language round these parts we believe. Check out <strong>A Little bit of C Programming</strong> for some Pointer Madness. Which will then lead to some <strong>Programming Pearls</strong> for all to learn from a case study of the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Pearls-Joe-Bentley/dp/8177588583">book</a>.</p>
