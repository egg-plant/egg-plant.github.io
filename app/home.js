        <p>Hello and congratulations on finding <strong>The Perks of Computer Science</strong>. This blog will become a
            treasure chest of technical and mathematical knowledge for all those interested in computer science and
            programming to use. Suitable for all but especially for those who like to learn with all the details and
            solid examples, no more algorithm teachers assumptions.</p>
        <p>Please check the side menu on the top left or the rather fancy buttons at the bottom to link to the sections.
            I cover the <strong>Fundamentals of Mathematics&#39;s</strong> starting with some BiteSize Maths a few
            Prerequisites from Stanford and finally looking in depth at the book Concrete Mathematics. A study
            of <strong>Mathematics for Computer Science</strong> using course content from <a
                href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm">MIT</a> and <a
                href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/">Stanford</a> follows using the fundamental
            knowledge. <strong>Algorithms</strong> will then be discussed in detail building them using a variety of
            languages such as C, Java, Python and Clojure. We then have a dig into the world of <strong>Functional
                Programming</strong> using the text book the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and
                Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</a> as the basis and Clojure as the main language. <strong>Hipster
                Clojure</strong> contains some great insight into our Clojure projects as well as some blog posts on
            interesting work going on in that space and frameworks used such as Kafka and Cassandra! The Kafka section
            is super interesting and is very full would definitely recommend it! Check out <strong>A Little bit of C
                Programming</strong> for some Pointer Madness. Which will
            then lead to some <strong>Distributed Systems</strong>. Finally a section
            on the overused term <strong>DevOps</strong> which will cover a large range of items.</p>
        <p><strong>Most of all have fun!</strong></p>
